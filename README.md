## Homelab Documentation

Welcome to my personal homelab documentation repository. This repo tracks the setup, configuration, and operational practices for my self-hosted infrastructure â€” designed with production-level standards in mind.

---

## Overview

This homelab is built on:

- **Proxmox VE 8.4.1** as the hypervisor
- **ZFS (RAID 1)** for resilient local storage
- **Automated snapshot management**
- Containerized services like **Pi-hole**, **Grafana**, and more
- Full documentation built with **MkDocs + Material Theme**

## Goals

- âœ… Learn and document real-world infrastructure practices
- âœ… Host and monitor my own stack
- âœ… Build a project portfolio for future cloud/infrastructure roles
- âœ… Make my setup reproducible for others

---

## Highlights

- ZFS mirror with automatic snapshotting
- Clean documentation flow with MkDocs + Material
- Air-gapped service isolation via containers
- Everything reproducible, version-controlled, and platform-ready

---

## Future Plans

- Add Ansible playbooks for provisioning
- Set up off-site snapshot syncing
- Integrate Prometheus & Grafana alerting
- Deploy more services: Vaultwarden, Jellyfin, Home Assistant
