# Grafana Monitoring Setup

> **Status:** ðŸš§ _This section is currently under construction._

This page will document the setup and configuration of **Grafana** in my homelab. It will include:

- How Grafana connects to data sources (e.g., InfluxDB, Pi-hole, Uptime Kuma)
- Dashboards for system metrics, network performance, DNS logs
- Deployment method (Docker Compose, LXC, etc.)
- Access control and reverse proxy setup (e.g., Nginx + Auth)

---

## Whatâ€™s Planned

- [ ] Install Grafana in Docker or LXC
- [ ] Connect to Prometheus or Uptime Kuma
- [ ] Create custom dashboards for ZFS, Proxmox, and DNS
- [ ] Secure admin interface with login + HTTPS
- [ ] Integrate with MkDocs site for visual previews

---

**Note to Self:** This page is stubbed to maintain project structure and signal future documentation goals.
